Git Flow Strategy
Git Flow is a branching model for Git, created by Vincent Driessen. It is a rigid branching model that assigns very specific roles to different branches and defines how and when they should interact. In Git Flow, the repository is divided into several branches with their own strict roles:

Master: The master branch stores the official release history.
Develop: The develop branch serves as an integration branch for features.
Feature: Each new feature should reside in its own branch, which can be pushed to the develop branch as they are completed.
Release: When enough features have been added to develop for a release, a release branch is created to start the release cycle, so no new features can be added after this pointâ€”only bug fixes, documentation generation, and other release-oriented tasks should go in this branch.
Hotfix: If an issue in production is detected a hotfix branch is created from master. Once the fix is complete, it is merged back into master and develop.
Workflow
A develop branch is created from master.
A release branch is created from develop.
Feature branches are created from develop.
When a feature is complete it is merged into the develop branch.
When the release branch is done it is merged into develop and master.
If an issue in master is detected a hotfix branch is created from master.
Once the hotfix is complete it is merged to both develop and master.

Note: Replace image.png with the actual path to the image in your repository.

To include the provided image in your README on a platform like GitHub, you would first need to upload the image to your repository and then reference it using the relative path in your markdown file. The text ![Git Flow Strategy](image.png) is a placeholder and should be replaced with the actual path to the image in your repository. If you're working with a markdown file locally or on a platform that supports direct image uploads, you can use the actual file path as shown.
